## 📦 Key Dependencies

- **Expo SDK 53**: React Native platform
- **Expo Router**: File-based navigation
- **AsyncStorage**: Persistent storage
- **Ionicons**: Icon library
- **TypeScript**: Type safety
- **SWR**: Data fetching (ready to use)
- **date-fns**: Date formatting

## 🔗 Integration with Backend

The app is designed to work with your existing Rails API:

```typescript
// Example API integration (to be implemented)
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://your-rails-api.com/api/v1';

// Your existing endpoints should work:
// POST /api/v1/sessions (login)
// GET /api/v1/items (products)
// POST /api/v1/orders (create order)
// etc.
```

## 🎯 Migration Benefits

1. **Native Performance**: 60fps animations and smooth scrolling
2. **Platform Features**: Push notifications, camera, location
3. **App Store Distribution**: Deploy to iOS App Store and Google Play
4. **Offline Capability**: Works without internet connection
5. **Native UI**: Platform-specific design patterns
6. **Code Reuse**: Shared business logic between platforms

## 💡 Tips for Continued Development

1. **Use Expo Router's typed routes** for type-safe navigation
2. **Leverage React Native's built-in components** before adding libraries
3. **Test on both iOS and Android** regularly
4. **Use Expo's managed workflow** for easier deployment
5. **Consider using NativeWind** for Tailwind-like styling if preferred

## 🤝 Contributing

The app structure follows React Native best practices:
- Keep components small and focused
- Use TypeScript for better developer experience
- Follow the existing file structure
- Test on multiple devices/simulators
