npx expo export -p web

# 2. Commit and push (includes the dist/ folder)
git add .
git commit -m "Frontend web changes"
git push origin main

# ✅ Auto-deploys to Netlify
# Check: https://guahan-grocer.netlify.app
```

### **iOS App (TestFlight/App Store)**
```bash
# 1. Build for iOS
eas build --platform ios --profile production-ios

# 2. Submit to TestFlight
eas submit --platform ios --latest

# 3. Wait 5-10 minutes for Apple processing
# 4. Update available in TestFlight app
# Check: https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/apps/6749652653/testflight/ios
```

### **Android App (Google Play)**
```bash

```bash
# For most changes (backend + frontend web):
npx expo export -p web  # Build web version
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin main     # Auto-deploys backend + web

# For iOS updates (manual):
eas build --platform ios --profile production-ios
eas submit --platform ios --latest

## 📦 Key Dependencies

- **Expo SDK 53**: React Native platform
- **Expo Router**: File-based navigation
- **AsyncStorage**: Persistent storage
- **Ionicons**: Icon library
- **TypeScript**: Type safety
- **SWR**: Data fetching (ready to use)
- **date-fns**: Date formatting

## 🔗 Integration with Backend

The app is designed to work with your existing Rails API:

```typescript
// Example API integration (to be implemented)
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://your-rails-api.com/api/v1';

// Your existing endpoints should work:
// POST /api/v1/sessions (login)
// GET /api/v1/items (products)
// POST /api/v1/orders (create order)
// etc.
```

## 🎯 Migration Benefits

1. **Native Performance**: 60fps animations and smooth scrolling
2. **Platform Features**: Push notifications, camera, location
3. **App Store Distribution**: Deploy to iOS App Store and Google Play
4. **Offline Capability**: Works without internet connection
5. **Native UI**: Platform-specific design patterns
6. **Code Reuse**: Shared business logic between platforms

## 💡 Tips for Continued Development

1. **Use Expo Router's typed routes** for type-safe navigation
2. **Leverage React Native's built-in components** before adding libraries
3. **Test on both iOS and Android** regularly
4. **Use Expo's managed workflow** for easier deployment
5. **Consider using NativeWind** for Tailwind-like styling if preferred

## 🤝 Contributing

The app structure follows React Native best practices:
- Keep components small and focused
